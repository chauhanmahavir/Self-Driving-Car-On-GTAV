# Test Dataset

# In this section we test our model

* First we load our neural network and then load our model.

* After that we convert our image into gray scale and we resize our image into 200 X 150.

* After that we predict movement of that frame and if prediction will cross our threshold then i will take move according to that threshold otherwise it will go straight.
