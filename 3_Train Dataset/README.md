## In this section we train our Dataset

* Here i am using modified alexnet you can use original alexnet for training.

* First we load our neural network with Image Height, Width and Learning rate.

* And we load our dataset file and then we divide train and test dataset.

* After that we seperate data into feature and label.

* And then we train our model and save with 'self_driving_car_gta5.model' name.

* After saving we got 4 file as below
